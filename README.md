# PulseMapper

This is the code corresponding to the paper:

**Mapping intracranial BOLD pulsatility without cardiac trace recordings**

Currently under review at Magnetic Resonance in Medicine 


This codebase can train and test a CNN to synthesize cardiac-related BOLD pulsatility maps from the power spectra of BOLD MRI data.
